# User Stories

+ As a developer I want to add buttons to each image and get a counter so that the researchers can analyze what the user/customer wants.
+ As a researcher I want to make sure there is 100% certainty that pictures won't be duplicated so that the user gets max variety of pictures at a time to get the best analaysis of results.
+ As a coder I want to make my code easily readable so that my fellow co-workers can hop on and help me and easily understand what each function does.
+ As a user I want all images to fit easily on the page so that I can view all images at once and easily compare what I want.
